## Requirements

 * PHP-ImageMagick


## Installation
A CiviCRM extensions folder (In new sites since CiviCRM v4.7.0, this defaults to `files/civicrm/ext`. For older systems, see [the wiki](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extensions).)

#### Option 1: CiviCRM.org Extension Directory
This option does not require any extra server side dependency. To intall using this option, simply download the latest versions of all three extensions below and install them in order:

1. [`Shoreditch Theme`](https://civicrm.org/extensions/shoreditch)
2. [`FlexMailer`](https://civicrm.org/extensions/flexmailer)
3. [`Mosaico CiviCRM Integration`](https://civicrm.org/extensions/email-template-builder)


#### Option 2: CLI

This option requires command line tool [`cv`](https://github.com/civicrm/cv)

```
cv dl --dev flexmailer shoreditch
cv dl uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico@https://download.civicrm.org/extension/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico/latest/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico-latest.zip
```

> Tip: If you're using v4.6.x with backports, then `cv dl` will require an
> extra argument: "`--filter-ver=4.7.16`".  This enables it to download the
> latest extensions intended for v4.7.x (even if they aren't officially
> compatible with v4.6.x).

#### Option 3: Git (preferred for development)
This option requires commad line tool [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)

other requirement by setup.sh:

 * [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [`NPM`](https://www.npmjs.com)
 * [`grunt-cli`](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
 * [`cv`](https://github.com/civicrm/cv)


Alternatively:

```
## Navigate to your extension directory, e.g.
cd sites/default/files/civicrm/ext

## Download the extensions
git clone https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.flexmailer
git clone https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.shoreditch
git clone https://github.com/veda-consulting/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico
cd uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico
./bin/setup.sh -D
```

## Getting started (Usage)

If you haven't used Mosaico before, consult the the demo and tutorial materials from http://mosaico.io/index.html.

To send a new mailing, simply navigate to "Mailings => New Mailing". The CiviMail-Mosaico UI should appear.

Optionally, you may design reusable templates by navigating to "Mailings => Mosaico Templates".

When composing a new mailing, the default layout is a simple three-step wizard.  To
change the layout, you can update the setting `mosaico_layout` to
`bootstrap-wizard` or `bootstrap-single`, e.g.

```
cv api setting.create mosaico_layout=bootstrap-wizard
```
The traditional and Mosaico versions of the New Mailing page can be accessed with these URL's:
- `civicrm/a/#/mailing/new/traditional` (new mailing with template_type=traditional)
- `civicrm/a/#/mailing/new/mosaico` (new mailing with template_type=mosaico)
- `civicrm/a/#/mailing/new` (new mailing with the default template type; depends on the mix of extensions)

## Having issues with this extension?

Please make sure you have followed installation instructions.

## Development

#### Setup.sh

The script `bin/setup.sh` handles various build activities:

```
## Download dependencies
./bin/setup.sh -D

## Regenerate DAOs
./bin/setup.sh -g

## Build zip archive
./bin/setup.sh -z
```

#### Styling Changes

We use Gulp and Sass for styling and handle different running tasks. Firstly, you should install node packages using npm package manager:
```
npm install
```

Styling changes should go into `sass` directory and compiled to CSS using the following command:
```
gulp sass
```


#### Patching Mosaico

This extensions ships with a patched version of Mosaico. The patches are maintained as a fork
in https://github.com/civicrm/mosaico using [Twigflow (Rebase)](https://gist.github.com/totten/39e932e5d10bc9e73e82790b2475eff2).

#### Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

#### Publication

Whenever a change is merged or pushed to `uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico`, a bot automatically builds a new `zip` archive
and publishes to [http://dist.civicrm.org/extension/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico/](http://dist.civicrm.org/extension/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico/).

The build/publish process has a few properties:
 * It combines [`uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico`](https://github.com/veda-consulting/uk.co.vedaconsulting.mosaico),
   [`civicrm/mosaic`](https://github.com/civicrm/mosaico), and any other runtime dependencies into one `zip` file.
 * The version number is determined by reading `info.xml` (`<version>`) and appending the current Unix timestamp.
   * Example: If the `version` is declared as `1.0.beta1`, then it will be published as `1.0.beta1.1478151288`.
 * Three files are published:
   * The `zip` archive
   * The new `info.xml` file
   * A JSON document describing the build.
 * An alias is provided under the folder `latest`.

The bot does *not* publish the new version to `civicrm.org`.  To do this, take the new `info.xml` file and manually
upload it.  Since `civicrm.org` provides a directory of past and current versions, be sure to specify the download-URL
for a specific version number (e.g.  `1.0.beta1.1478151288`) rather than an alias (`latest`).
